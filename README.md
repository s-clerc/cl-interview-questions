# cl-interview-questions
List of interview questions involving (Common) Lisp. 
I'm preparing this because I found it hard to prepare for my Lisp interview as there simply weren't any resources avaliable, except some ad-riddled sites with really bad questions (e.g. _Who invented Lisp?_).

## Common Lisp questions
0. What are special variables in Common Lisp?
1. What is a symbol?
2. How does the reader work? Why are symbols always upper-case?
3. How do generic-functions work? 
    1. What is an applicable method?
    2. What order are methods run in the effective function?
    3. How do we control that order?
    4. What is a method combination? 
5. How do we organise code in Lisp?
6. What is a pathname? 
7. What's the simplest way to create and use a set?
8. What's the difference between an alist and a plist? What are the considerations when using either?
